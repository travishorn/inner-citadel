# Interconnectedness

Humans are **not isolated individuals**, but part of a vast, **interconnected
system**. Just as individual parts of the body contribute to the whole organism,
every person has a [role within the larger community](duty-others.md) of
humanity. [We are all part of a greater whole](global-citizenship.md), and
acting selfishly or against the common good is like a body part trying to harm
the body. Acting for the common good contributes to the harmony of everyone.

[Your actions](actions.md) ripple through the structure of society in ways you
cannot immediately see. No event happens in isolation. Every choice you make and
every action you take is a part of this large interconnected web. Have sympathy
for the world itself and everything in it. This goes beyond human-to-human
relationships.

When you [act with virtue](acting-virtue.md), it is more than just a personal
choice: It is a [contribution to the well-being of
everything](cosmopolitanism.md). Acting against virtue (through greed,
destruction, or other means) violates the rational order that connects
everything together.
