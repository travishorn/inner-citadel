# Reflecting on Death

Remember you must die. Knowing this, take meaningful action and live a virtuous
life. Reflecting on the inevitability of death is not a morbid exercise. It is a
**crucial reminder of the impermanence of life**. Focus on what truly matters
now to help you prioritize [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md), [wisdom](wisdom.md),
and [living according to nature](living-accordance-nature.md). Live fully in
[the present](time-present-moment.md), making the best use of your time in
pursuing [happiness and flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md).

Reflect on death to build [emotional resilience](emotional-resilience.md) and
[freedom from disturbance](freedom-disturbance.md). Detach yourself from any
[fear](fear.md) or anxiety about it. Death is part of the natural order. Fearing
it is irrational since it is an inevitable part of life's cycle. Reflecting on
death should inspire you to act meaningfully and focus on how you live.

Regularly remind yourself of your own mortality. **Accept it.** Allow yourself
to face it with peace rather than dread.
