# Reflecting on Death

Remember that you must die. Knowing this, take meaningful action and live a
virtuous life now. Reflecting on the inevitability of death is not a morbid
exercise. It is a **crucial reminder of the impermanence of life**. Focus on
what truly matters now to help you prioritize [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md),
[wisdom](wisdom.md), and [living according to
nature](living-accordance-nature.md). Live fully in [the
present](time-present-moment.md), making the best use of your time in pursuing
[happiness and flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md).

Reflect on death to build [emotional resilience](emotional-resilience.md) and
[inner peace](inner-peace.md). Detach yourself from any [fear](fear.md) or
anxiety about it. Death is part of the natural order. Fearing it is irrational
since it is an inevitable part of life's cycle. Reflecting on death should
inspire you to act meaningfully and focus on how you live.

Regularly remind yourself of your own mortality. [**Accept it.**](love-fate.md)
Allow yourself to face it with [courage](courage.md) and peace rather than
dread.
