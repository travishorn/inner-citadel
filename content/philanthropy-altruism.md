# Philanthropy & Altruism

**Your [duty to others](duty-others.md)** includes philanthropy ("love of
humanity"). **Help others whenever you can** and **avoid acting selfishly**. Do
not do anything that harms society. Help others to fulfill your role as rational
and social person. Remember that the welfare of others is
[interconnected](interconnectedness.md) with your own well-being.

Helping others is part of the [natural order of
things](living-accordance-nature.md). Deliberately (rather than impulsively)
give. Help others when it aligns with [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md). Think about
what truly benefits others. Do not simply seek to ease suffering in a
superficial way. This goes beyond giving material things. Promote the
[flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md) of others' just as you seek flourishing
yourself.

It is not about self-sacrifice, but about acting in accordance with reason,
where the good of others is interconnected with your own pursuit of virtue. By
helping others, you fulfill your true potential. Do not worry about the [outcome
of any altruism](outcomes-our-efforts.md). Focus on doing what is morally right
without expecting recognition. Do not seek to be seen as charitable.
