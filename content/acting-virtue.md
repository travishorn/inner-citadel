# Acting with Virtue

Focus on these virtues: [wisdom](wisdom.md), [courage](courage.md),
[justice](justice.md), and [temperance](temperance.md). By **acting according to
them**, you will find inner stability, which reduces emotional distress.
[Destructive Emotions](destructive-emotions.md) like [anger](anger.md),
[envy](envy-jealousy.md), and [fear](fear.md) are not aligned with virtuous
living because they cloud your judgment and lead to irrational
[actions](actions.md).

Through [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) you find [true
happiness](inner-peace.md). External circumstances like wealth, health,
or social status are [indifferent](dichotomy-control.md#indifferents) to your
well-being and _do not_ determine happiness. Instead, you find happiness by
living in [accordance with nature](living-accordance-nature.md), which means
acting with virtue. If you cultivate virtue and align with nature, you live in
harmony with yourself and the world. Since virtue is [entirely within our
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control), it is a reliable
source of lasting happiness.

Another way to define virtue is acting with perfect reason and character. It is
[the ability to discern what is good, bad, or indifferent](wisdom.md), [strength
in the face of adversity](courage.md), [fairness & doing what is
right](justice.md), and [self-control](temperance.md). The virtues form an
interconnected framework, meaning you cannot possess one without the others. Act
rationally and consistently with these principles.

We cannot control external events or the actions of others. But we have complete
control over our own reactions and decisions. In situations outside your
control, act with virtue adhering to wisdom and temperance. If you suffer
misfortune, do not despair but instead focus on your response. Recognize that
the event itself is indifferent. The only thing that matters is how you respond
to it.
