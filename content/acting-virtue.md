# Acting with Virtue

Focus on these virtues: [wisdom](wisdom.md), [courage](courage.md),
[justice](justice.md), and [temperance](temperance.md). By **acting according to
them**, you will find inner stability, which reduces emotional distress.
[Destructive Emotions](destructive-emotions.md) like [anger](anger.md),
[envy](envy-jealousy.md), and [fear](fear.md) are not aligned with virtuous
living because they cloud your judgment and lead to irrational
[actions](actions.md).

Through [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) you find [true
happiness](inner-peace.md). External circumstances like wealth, health,
or social status are [indifferent](dichotomy-control.md#indifferents) to your
well-being and _do not_ determine happiness. Instead, you find happiness by
living in [accordance with nature](living-accordance-nature.md), which means
acting with virtue. If you cultivate virtue and align with nature, you live in
harmony with yourself and the world. Since virtue is [entirely within our
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control), it is a reliable
source of lasting happiness.

Strive for perfect reason and character: work on your ability to make good
judgments, be strong through adversity, do what is right, and practice
self-control. Wisdom, courage, justice, and temperance are an interconnected
framework. You cannot possess one without the others.

You cannot control external events or the actions of others. But you do have
complete control over your own reaction. In situations outside your control, act
with virtue. If you suffer some misfortune, do not despair but instead focus on
your response. Recognize that the event itself is indifferent. The only thing
that matters is how you respond to it.
