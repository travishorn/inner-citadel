# Courage

Courage is the **strength to face adversity** with resilience and confidence. It
is essential for withstanding difficulties of all shapes. Acting with courage
means acting according to virtue, despite any fear you might have. Use courage
to handle adversity without compromising your [values](acting-virtue.md) or
[emotional composure](emotional-resilience.md).

Face life's challenges with inner strength. Courage is more than just physical
bravery. It is an internal strength that enables you to confront uncertainty
without being overwhelmed by destructive emotions like [fear](fear.md) or
[anger](anger.md). Understand that external events are [beyond your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control). However, you have a
choice in how you react to them. Prioritize your integrity over external
outcomes.

[Accept your fate](love-fate.md) and recognize that many things in life are
beyond your control. This includes death and misfortune. Do not avoid this
reality. Instead, use courage to embrace it. Refuse to be swayed by fear.
Maintaining your character is healthy and beneficial to your [inner
peace](inner-peace.md).
