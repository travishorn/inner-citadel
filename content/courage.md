# Courage

Courage is the **strength to face adversity** with resilience and confidence. It
is essential for withstanding difficulties of all shapes. Acting with courage
means acting according to virtue, despite any fear you might have. Use courage
to handle adversity without compromising your [values](acting-virtue.md) or
[emotional composure](emotional-resilience.md).

Face life's challenges with inner strength. Courage is more than just physical
bravery. It is an internal strength that enables you to confront uncertainty
without being overwhelmed by destructive emotions like fear or anger. Understand
that external events are [beyond your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control). However, you have a
choice in how you react to them. Prioritize your integrity over external
outcomes.

Courage means [accepting your fate](love-fate.md) and recognizing that many
things in life are beyond your control. This includes death and misfortune. Do
not avoid this reality. Instead, use courage to embrace it. When you refuse to
be swayed by fear, you act with the virtue of courage. Maintaining your
character is healthy and beneficial to your inner peace.
