# Inner Peace

Strive to **be free from [destructive or excessive
emotions](destructive-emotions.md)**. That does not mean total emotional
detachment but rather avoiding [irrational emotions](destructive-emotions.md)
that lead to distress. Emotions can be **healthy**, rational and aligned with
virtue. For example, joy you derive from [wisdom](wisdom.md) is good. But they
can also be **unhealthy**, irrational, and not aligned with virtue. For example,
[anger](anger.md) stems from your misjudgment about what is truly valuable in
life. Do not seek to eliminate all your feelings. Instead, try to experience
only rational emotions to achieve emotional serenity.

Also strive for a state of **unshakable calmness**. Freedom from distress (like
anxiety) is the end result of achieving inner peace and living in harmony with
nature. [Live in accordance with nature and reason](living-accordance-nature.md)
to achieve a lasting sense of inner peace.

**Accept reality**. When faced with adversity, acknowledge that you cannot
change external events. Respond to them in a way that reflects [your
values](cardinal-virtues.md). With practice, you will find emotional serenity
and a state of inner peace because you no longer fight against the inevitable or
worry about things beyond your control.
