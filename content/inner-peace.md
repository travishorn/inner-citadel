# Inner Peace

Strive to **be free from [destructive or excessive
emotions](destructive-emotions.md)**. That does not mean total emotional
detachment but rather avoiding [irrational
emotions](passions-irrational-judgments.md) that lead to distress. Emotions can
be **healthy**, rational and aligned with virtue. For example, joy you derive
from [wisdom](wisdom.md) is good. But they can also be **unhealthy**,
irrational, and not aligned with virtue. For example, [anger](anger.md) stems
from your misjudgment about what is truly valuable in life. Do not seek to
eliminate all your feelings. Instead, try to experience only rational emotions
to achieve [serenity](emotional-resilience.md).

Also strive for a state of **unshakable calmness**. Freedom from distress (like
anxiety) is the end result of achieving inner peace and living in harmony with
nature. [Live in accordance with nature and reason](living-accordance-nature.md)
to achieve a lasting sense of inner peace.

**Accept reality**. When faced with adversity, acknowledge that you cannot
change external events. Respond to them in a way that reflects [your
values](cardinal-virtues.md). With practice, you will find emotional serenity
and a state of inner peace because you [no longer fight against the
inevitable](love-fate.md) or worry about things beyond your control.
