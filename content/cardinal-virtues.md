# Cardinal Virtues

The **foundation of ethical living** and the path to [happiness and
flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md) can be found in these four virtues.

1. [Wisdom](wisdom.md)
2. [Courage](courage.md)
3. [Justice](justice.md)
4. [Temperance](temperance.md)

They are the interconnected framework for living the good life. You cannot have
one without the others. Wisdom guides action, courage promotes perseverance,
justice governs relationships, and temperance ensures balance. Together, they
help you live in harmony with nature and the world around you.

The beautiful thing is that these virtues are all completely [within your
control](dichotomy-control.md). They are the essence of human nature. Live
according to them and you [live according to
nature](living-accordance-nature.md), bringing true goodness into your life.

Acting with virtue is a lifelong process in which you continuously strive for
improvement. While complete virtue is rare and difficult to obtain, use a
theoretical sage who fully embodies the virtues as a role model to aspire to.
