# Thoughts & Judgments

Your **interpretations of events**, the **values you assign** to things, and
**how you mentally react** to situations are entirely [under your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control). You can choose
whether you see an event as as good, bad, or neutral. For example, if someone
insults you, you can choose to be offended or you can choose to remain calm and
unaffected. Recognize that the insult does not affect your moral character, and
the choice becomes easy.

Thoughts and judgments are the key to how you experience the world. It is not
the events themselves that upset you, but how you respond to them. You have the
power to control your reactions by changing how you interpret things. Stay calm
even in difficult situations.

Do not judge things as purely good or bad right away. Try to understand them
clearly, without letting your emotions take over. Focus on what you can control
and let go of what you cannot. This leads to [inner
peace](inner-peace.md) and [wisdom](wisdom.md), no matter what happens.
