# Temperance

Temperance is exercising **self-control** and **moderation** in all areas of
life. [Regulate your desires, emotions, and actions](emotional-resilience.md) to
make sure that you are guided by reason rather than impulses or [external
desires](external-events.md). By practicing temperance, you can achieve [inner
peace](inner-peace.md) and live a virtuous life.

Do not be ruled by your desires. Stay calm and balanced. Avoid extremes like
eating too much, spending too much money, or reacting too strongly to external
events. Focus on [what really matters](cardinal-virtues.md) without being
distracted by unnecessary things.

Use temperance to avoid being overwhelmed by [anger](anger.md), [fear](fear.md),
and sadness. [Happiness](happiness-flourishing.md) comes from being in control
of yourself, not from quick pleasures or from avoiding discomfort. Temperance
helps you make better decisions and [act with virtue](acting-virtue.md). Focus
on long-term goals rather than instant gratification.
