# Temperance

Temperance is exercising **self-control** and **moderation** in all areas of
life. [Regulate your desires, emotions, and actions](emotional-resilience.md) to
make sure that you are guided by reason rather than impulses or [external
desires](external-events.md). By practicing temperance, you can achieve [inner
peace](freedom-disturbance.md) and live a purposeful.

Do not be ruled by your desires. Stay calm and balanced. Avoid extremes like
eating too much, spending too much money, or reacting too strongly to external
events. Focus on [what really matters](cardinal-virtues.md) without being
distracted by unnecessary things.

Use temperance to avoid being overwhelmed by [anger](anger.md), [fear](fear.md),
and sadness. [Happiness](happiness-flourishing.md) comes from being in control
of yourself, not from quick pleasures or from avoiding discomfort. Temperance
helps you make better decisions and [act with virtue](acting-virtue.md). Focus
on long-term goals rather than instant gratification.
