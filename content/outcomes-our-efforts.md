# Outcomes of Our Efforts

While you can control your actions, you **cannot control the ultimate outcome**
of your actions. The results are influenced by factors outside your direct
power, like chance, timing, other peoples' actions. [Do not attach
yourself](detachment-externals.md) to specific outcomes. Instead, focus on doing
your best in the moment, leaving the results to unfold as they will.

Your [thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md), intentions, and [actions](actions.md)
are within your control. Accept that outcomes are beyond it. Strive to perform
your duties to the best of your ability, guided by
[virtue](cardinal-virtues.md), without becoming overly attached to the results.
Remain calm in the face of both success and failure.

All outcomes are a part of the [natural order of
things](living-accordance-nature.md). Rather than cursing your failures or
excessively celebrating your your success, take a balanced view that [recognizes
the transient nature all outcomes](love-fate.md). Understanding how to view the
outcomes of your efforts leads to [emotional
resilience](emotional-resilience.md) and adaptibility.
