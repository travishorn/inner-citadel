# Passions as Irrational Judgments

[Passions](destructive-emotions.md) (destructive emotions) are **not inevitable
human experiences** but **irrational judgments** based on false beliefs. For
example, [fear](fear.md) arises because we believe that something external (like
pain) is inherently bad, and [anger](anger.md) occurs because we perceive an
injustice. In reality, these external events are not under your control so your
reaction should be indifferent. The negative emotions you feel toward them
result from incorrect thinking.

Intense emotions like fear, desire, [grief](grief.md), and anger all come from
[attachment to external things](detachment-externals.md) and lead to destructive
feelings. True goodness lies in [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md). Passions distract
you from achieving [inner peace](inner-peace.md) and
[wisdom](wisdom.md).

Practice [negative visualization](negative-visualization.md) and [cognitive
reappraisal](cognitive-reappraisal.md) to understand that judgments are
[interpretations](thoughts-judgments.md) rather than facts.
