# Actions

How you choose to **behave**, what you **say**, and what you **do** are directly
within your control. [Act with virtue](acting-virtue.md) regardless of the
circumstances. No matter what happens externally, you have the power to act with
[wisdom](wisdom.md), [justice](justice.md), [courage](courage.md), and
[temperance](temperance.md).

You control your words, your tone, and your presentation. Speak thoughtfully and
avoid harmful words. Communicate truthfully and avoid emotionally charged
responses. This way, your words pack a powerful combination of being
constructive and reflecting your values.

The physical things you do are also within your control. This includes [how you
handle tasks](actions.md), [how you treat others](duty-others.md), and the
choices you make. Act with purpose. Make every action reflect your virtues.
Focus on what can be done well and do not become attached to outcomes beyond
your control.

Regulate how you respond to external events, especially under pressure.
[Maintain composure](emotional-resilience.md), be patient, and stick to your
principles in all circumstances. Cultivate emotional discipline to remain
grounded in virtue. Assert control over your own actions by controlling
impulsive reactions and behaving consistently with your standards.
