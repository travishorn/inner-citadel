# Grief

Grief stems from the **attachment to external things** (such as loved ones or
possessions). Understand that their loss is not inherently harmful. Acknowledge
the loss but remind yourself that everything in life is temporary and [beyond
your control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control). Think of loved
ones as "on loan" from the universe, so that when they are gone, you are
grateful rather than devastated.

Grief is emotional distress. It comes from [misjudgment about the loss](passions-irrational-judgments.md) of
external things. [Do not place value on
things beyond your control](detachment-externals.md), including the lives or
health of loved ones. Even those are external to your inner self. Grief may
arise, but it should be moderated. Losses are not truly harmful. Death is not
inherently evil. They are part of natural order.

External events are indifferent by nature. So grief from loss and
[fear](fear.md) of future losses are misguided. Focus on cultivating
[courage](courage.md), align your judgments with reason, and accept that loss is
inevitable. Focus on your response to loss rather than the loss itself.
