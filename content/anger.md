# Anger

Anger is one of the most **destructive** emotions because it is both harmful and
irrational. It comes from a [perceived injury or
injustice](passions-irrational-judgments.md) and leads to irrational
[actions](actions.md). It does not come from any external event itself, but from
your reaction to it.

When faced with anger, [reframe the situation](cognitive-reappraisal.md) by
recognizing that the harm is external and **not a threat** to your character.
Remind yourself that people act out of ignorance and that responding with anger
only hurts yourself.

Watch for anger in bad judgment, unrealistic expectations, desire for
[control](dichotomy-control.md), [attachment to external
things](detachment-externals.md), ego, and pride.
