# The Past

Regret serves no useful purpose because **the past cannot be changed**. What has
happened is part of the [natural order](living-accordance-nature.md), and any
emotional attachment to it only leads to unnecessary suffering. Instead, accept
what has already occurred as part of life unfolding. Learn from it and use the
wisdom gained to guide [your present actions](actions.md). Reflect on the past
with the goal of learning how to better live in the [present
moment](time-present-moment.md).

Dwelling on the past hinders your ability to live in the present. Free yourself
from the burden of regret by understanding that the past is [beyond your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control). Focus on your
reaction to past events and how you can apply any lessons learned to improve
your character.

Accept the past. Each experience (positive or negative) contributes to your
growth. Look back for ways to enhance your [wisdom](wisdom.md). Use reason to
guide your response to life's challenges. Honor the past but prioritize the
present.
