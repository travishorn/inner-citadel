# Justice

Justice is the **commitment to fairness**, **[respect for
others](respect-others.md)**, and the **recognition of the [interconnectedness
of humanity](interconnectedness.md)**, ensuring that all are treated equally. It
goes beyond personal duties to include social responsibilities, promoting the
common good, and contributing positively to society. It is a part of
[cosmopolitanism](cosmopolitanism.md), where all humans are part of a single
universal community, connected by shared reason and moral duty.

Justice is more than a legal framework. It is a part of your duty to [live
according to nature](living-accordance-nature.md). Treat others with fairness,
honesty, and kindness. Recognizing human dignity. All people are equal, so act
in the best interest of the whole community, rather than selfishly pursuing your
own desires.

Pay attention to your own [intentions and attitudes](thoughts-judgments.md).
[Act](actions.md) justly even when it is difficult; even when others do not act
justly in return. Act with fairness, fulfill your social duties, respect others'
rights, and work for the welfare of everyone. This is important for [living with
virute](acting-virtue.md), which leads to [happiness](happiness-flourishing.md).
