# Voluntary Discomfort

Build [emotional resilience](emotional-resilience.md), cultivate [inner
strength](courage.md), and increase gratitude for what you have by
**intentionally exposing yourself to temporary, controlled discomfort or
hardships**. This helps you [avoid relying too much on comfort and
pleasure](detachment-externals.md), which themselves rely on [external
circumstances](external-events.md). Train your mind to remain calm and rational
even when faced with difficulty.

## Examples

- Go without food for a brief period to remind yourself that life goes on even
  when you are hungry.
- Wear light clothing and endure cold temperatures briefly to toughen your body
  and mind.
- Spend time without luxuries to realize that happiness does not depend on
  wealth.
- Engage in physical fitness that pushes your body and mind, such as hard
  exercise and long walks.
- Face your fears and anxieties head on. This could be speaking in public, doing
  something uncomfortable in a social setting, or just stepping outside your
  usual routine.
- **Train your mind** to remain calm regardless of external conditions. Gain
  mastery over your fears and desires. Live according to reason rather than
  indulgence.
