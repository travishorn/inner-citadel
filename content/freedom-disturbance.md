# Freedom from Disturbance

**Emotional serenity** and **inner peace** are crucial elements in achieving a
virtuous life.

## Emotional Serenity

Strive to be free from [destructive or excessive
emotions](destructive-emotions.md). That does not mean total emotional
detachment but rather avoiding [irrational emotions](destructive-emotions.md)
that lead to disturbance. Emotions can be **healthy**, rational and aligned with
virtue. For example,  joy you derive from [wisdom](wisdom.md) is good. But they
can also be **unhealthy**, irrational, and misaligned with virtue. For example,
[anger](anger.md) stems from your misjudgment about what is truly valuable in
life. Do not seek to eliminate all feelings, but strive to experience only
rational emotions to achieve emotional serenity.

## Inner Peace

Similarly, strive for a state of unshakable calmness. Freedom from mental
disturbance (such as anxiety) is the end result of achieving inner peace and
living in harmony with nature. [Live in accordance with nature and
reason](living-accordance-nature.md) to achieve a lasting sense of inner peace.

**Accept reality**. When faced with adversity, acknowledge that you cannot
change external events. Respond to them in a way that reflects [your
values](cardinal-virtues.md). With practice, you will find emotional serenity
and a state of inner peace because you no longer fight against the inevitable or
worry about things beyond your control.
