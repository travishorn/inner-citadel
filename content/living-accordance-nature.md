# Living in Accordance with Nature

**Align yourself with the natural order of things.** [Accept
everything](love-fate.md), including life's difficulties. Even hardships have a
place within nature, so resisting them is irrational. Face adversity with
[virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) and [resilience](emotional-resilience.md).

Human reason is a small part of a larger whole. Everything that exists and
everything that happens is [part of a greater, meaningful
whole](interconnectedness.md). Strive to live in harmony with it.

Everything is subject to change: people, possessions, and even your own body.
Accept this to free yourself from unhealthy desires and aversions. [Do not cling
to fleeting things.](detachment-externals.md) Everything comes and goes as part
of nature's cycle. Focus on [cultivating virtue](acting-virtue.md) and [what you
can control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control) (your own
responses and choices) rather than external things that are not permanent.
