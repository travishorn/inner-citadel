# Role of Reason

Reason is your **main method of controlling your
[passions](destructive-emotions.md)**. Emotions are products of your
interpretation of events. By using reason to determine your judgment about what
is truly good or bad, you can adjust your emotional responses. For example, when
you understand that [death is a natural part of life](reflecting-death.md)
rather than something to be [feared](fear.md), you can avoid the distress that
comes with fearing it.

[All people possess reason](shared-rational-nature.md). It is the spark that
[connects](interconnectedness.md) us to the universe and each other. It gives
everything order, structure, and purpose. It is at your core. [Align your reason
with nature](living-accordance-nature.md) to [live in harmony with
it](inner-peace.md). Reason is not just a tool for solving problems. It
is a way to better understand your place in the world.

Reason is essential for developing [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md).
[Wisdom](wisdom.md) is the ability to make good judgments about what is truly
good or bad. Use reason to guide wisdom. Use it to determine [what is within
your control is beyond it](dichotomy-control.md). Use it to control emotions by
[putting them in perspective](cognitive-reappraisal.md).

Find [happiness](happiness-flourishing.md) through reason. Accept the natural
order of things, even through challenges. [Respond with
virtue](acting-virtue.md) to maintain [inner peace](inner-peace.md).
