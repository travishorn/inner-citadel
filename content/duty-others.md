# Duty to Others

Recognize the unity of all humans. You have an **obligation to act with
kindness, justice, and fairness** toward others. Fulfill your duties to others
because it is the natural thing to do, not for personal gain. Act with
[justice](justice.md), treating others equally and working for the common good.
Your duty to others extends beyond family and friends to all people. We are all
members of the same [universal community](cosmopolitanism.md).

We are naturally social and rational beings. We are designed to live in harmony
with one another. You have obligations to those around you based on your role
and relationship. Fulfilling these duties is essential to your own inner peace.

- The duty of a parent is to care for their children.
- The duty of a leader is to [serve the community](community-engagement.md).
- The duty of a friend is to offer support and companionship.

Your duty to others should not based on personal feelings, preferences, or
convenience. It is based on a rational understanding of what is just and
appropriate in every situation. Act for the benefit of others out of a sense of
duty and moral obligation rather than for personal gain. Act with fairness,
kindness, and integrity, even when it is difficult or when your desires conflict
with your responsibilities. This is a form of rational love for humanity.
Contribute to the common good by fulfilling your role to the best of your
ability because [it aligns with your nature](living-accordance-nature.md).
