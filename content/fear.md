# Fear

Fear, especially the fear of loss or death, is based on the belief that
**something external is inherently bad**. This is a [false
judgment](passions-irrational-judgments.md).

[Do not assign value to things outside your control](detachment-externals.md),
like wealth, status, or health. With no value assigned to them, you will not
fear losing them. Those things are indifferent (not inherently good nor bad).
There is no reason to fear losing external things because they do not impact
your character.

[Reflect on death](reflecting-death.md) and recognize that it is a natural
process. Fear diminishes when you accept that life and death are both part of
the rational order of things. [You are a part of a larger, rational
universe.](global-citizenship.md) Everything that happens is part of it. You
cannot achieve [inner peace](freedom-disturbance.md) while living in fear of
natural and inevitable events.
