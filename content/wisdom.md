# Wisdom

Develop the ability to **understand what is truly important** in life and how to
[live in harmony with the natural order of things](living-accordance-nature.md).
Learn the difference between [what you can control and what you
cannot](dichotomy-control.md). A wise person focuses on what they can control
and [improving their character](acting-virtue.md) rather than trying to control
[external events](external-events.md).

Emotions like [fear](fear.md) and [anger](anger.md) come from misunderstanding
what is good or bad. Wisdom teaches you that goodness is building virtuous
character. So, the only _real_ bad is failing to act virtuously. External things
do not affect your [inner peace](inner-peace.md) if you have wisdom.

Having wisdom means [accepting life's challenges without
complaining](love-fate.md).
