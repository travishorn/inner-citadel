# Cognitive Reappraisal

**Reframe negative events in a rational light**. Rather than viewing a situation
as _bad_, reinterpret it according to [your principles](cardinal-virtues.md).
Prevent [destructive emotions](destructive-emotions.md) like [anger](anger.md)
from arising by shifting your perspective.

## Examples

If you lose your job, your initial reaction may be despair. You may view it as a
horrible thing that has happened. Instead, you can reappraise the event: It may
be a blessing in disguise. Maybe you are now free from something that was not
aligned with your principles anyway. Now that you no longer have your job, you
may have a chance to learn and grow.

If your friend betrays you, your initial reaction may be anger and hurt. You may
feel like you can never trust anyone again. Instead, understand their
[actions](actions.md) are outside your control. Your friend may be misguided,
but now how do you respond? You have an opportunity to practice forgiveness, you
may find things to learn from the experience. You now have more information
about your friend and you are [wiser](wisdom.md) for it.

If you become sick, you may initially think that it is unfair and it ruins
important plans. You may face [fear](fear.md). Instead, understand that illness
is a natural part of life. It is not good or bad. You have a choice in how it
impacts your mind, though. Use it as an opportunity to practice resilience. You
body may be suffering, but your mind remains strong. Although you are sick, it
does not stop you from practicing gratitude.
