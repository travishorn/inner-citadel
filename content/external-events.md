# External Events

An external event is anything [outside of your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control).

**Natural occurrences** like earthquakes, storms, and disease outbreaks are all
natural, inevitable, and outside your control.

**How others behave**, what choices they make, how they treat us, and what they
say are all their own [actions](actions.md) and choices, and are outside your
control.

While you can take steps to prevent illness, **whether you ultimately fall ill**
is outside your control. Aging and [death](reflecting-death.md) are inevitable
and outside your control.

Your success with **money** and **status** are external outcomes. Market
conditions, luck, and trends are outside your control.

You can protest and vote, but the **decisions of leaders** and laws passed by
governments are not under your direct control. War and conflict can impact you,
but they are also outside your control.

You may [prefer certain outcomes](preferred-dispreferred-indifferents.md), and
you should work toward them. However, understand that the outcome is not
something you can control, so you should not let it disturb you. Instead, place
your energy in [living a virtuous life](acting-virtue.md). Place your hopes and
dreams in things you can control, such as your own mind and character.
