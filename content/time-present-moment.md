# Time & The Present Moment

The only moment we truly have is the present. **Focus on what you can do here
and now.** Do not be distracted by regret over the past or anxiety about the
future. This is essential for having [inner peace](freedom-disturbance.md) and
[acting with virtue](acting-virtue.md).

The past has already happened and the future is uncertain. So, the present
moment is the only time you control. Regret serves no useful purpose because
[the past](past.md) cannot be changed. Since [the future](future.md) is also
beyond your control, do not let it disturb your peace of mind, either.

Live in the present to live with focus and clarity. Accept the past, do not
worry about the future, and concentrate on acting with virtue now, which will
lead to [happiness and flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md).
