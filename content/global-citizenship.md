# Global Citizenship

Think of yourself as a **citizen of the world**, focusing on what unites all
people rather than what divides them.

You have a universal identity beyond local affiliations. All humans as part of a
single, [interconnected community](interconnectedness.md). Your [duties to
others](duty-others.md) encompasses a broader sense of belonging based on
[shared humanity](shared-rational-nature.md).

Actively engage in the world as a member of the global community. [Live in
accordance with universal justice and natural law.](living-accordance-nature.md)
Recognize that your [actions](actions.md) should benefit humanity as a whole,
not just your immediate social groups.

You have a [moral responsibility](respect-others.md) toward the entire human
race. Commit yourself to universal [justice](justice.md).
