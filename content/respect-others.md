# Respect for Others

Treat all individuals (even those you might consider enemies) with **dignity and
respect**. Everyone deserves to be treated according to the same principles of
[justice](justice.md).

To hold respect for others, consider the [shared rational
nature](shared-rational-nature.md) of all people. All people are fundamentally
equal because we are [all part of the same rational order](cosmopolitanism.md).
Respect does not depend on [external things](external-events.md) like status,
wealth, or power. Even when it comes to people who have wronged you, maintain a
sense of justice and fairness. Treat them with the same respect as anyone else.
Do not condone harmful [actions](actions.md), but respond in a way that [aligns
with virtue](acting-virtue.md) anyway. Avoid reacting with [anger](anger.md).

We are social. We should cooperate with each other. Acknowledge this
[interconnectedness](interconnectedness.md) by having respect for others. Your
well-being is connected to the well-being of others. Everyone plays a role in
society. Respecting others is part of contributing to the harmony of everyone.
See beyond your differences with others. Promote compassion, which is crucial
for a [flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md) society.
