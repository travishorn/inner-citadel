# Love of Fate

**Embrace all events**, good and bad, as a part of the [natural order of
things](living-accordance-nature.md). Welcome everything that happens as
necessary. Nothing occurs without reason. [Every event has its
place.](interconnectedness.md) Learn to love your fate by realizing that
adversity is not an obstacle, but an opportunity to practice
[virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) and grow as a person.

Do not just accept fate, **actively celebrate it**. Every moment contributes to
the beautiful unfolding of life. Each moment is an essential part of your (and
everyone's) journey.

Knowing that you are a small part of a [larger whole](global-citizenship.md), do
not focus on what happens to you. Instead, focus on your response to it. Use
exercises like [self-reflection](self-reflection.md) to practice gratitude for
all experiences you have in life.
