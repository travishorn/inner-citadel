# Love of Fate

**Embrace all events**, good and bad, as a part of the [natural order of
things](living-accordance-nature.md). Welcome everything that happens as
necessary. Nothing occurs without reason. Every event has it's place. Learn to
love your fate by realizing that adversity is not an obstacle, but an
opportunity to practice [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) and grow as a person.

Do not just accept fate, **actively celebrate it**. Every moment contributes to
the beautiful unfolding life. Each moment is an essential part of your ([and the
everyone's](interconnectedness.md)) journey.

Knowing that you are a small part of a [larger whole](global-citizenship.md), do
not focus on what happens to you. Instead, focus on your response to it. Use
tools like [self-reflection](self-reflection.md) to practice gratitude for all
experiences you have in life.
