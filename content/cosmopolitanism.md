# Cosmopolitanism

There is a **brotherhood of all humanity**. Every person is a citizen of the
world, not belonging to a specific tribe or nation alone.

[All people possess reason](shared-rational-nature.md). It is the spark that
connects us to the universe and each other. We are not isolated individuals, but
part of an [interconnected system](interconnectedness.md). Recognizing the unity
of humanity means an [obligation to act with kindness, justice, and
fairness](duty-others.md) toward others. This goes all the way into
[philanthropy](philanthropy-altruism.md), which literally means "love of
humanity." Embrace the idea that [we should treat others justly](justice.md), no
matter what.

Treat all individuals (even "enemies") with [dignity and
respect](respect-others.md). Be an [active member of your
community](community-engagement.md) working toward the common good. You are a
[citizen of the world](global-citizenship.md). This means you transcend local or
national identities. Focusing on what unites all people rather than what divides
them.

Seek to foster universal compassion and responsibility. Encourage yourself to
work for the collective good. The welfare of one is tied to the welfare of all.
