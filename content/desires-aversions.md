# Desires & Aversions

Your internal desires (what you **pursue or avoid**) are within your control.
Align your desires with [what is virtuous](acting-virtue.md) and do not chase
superficial pleasures. Similarly, you can control what you avoid. Teach yourself
to be indifferent to external hardships like pain and loss because they do not
affect your moral character.

Desires and aversions are key areas where you can cultivate discipline. Your
desires should be aligned with nature and reason. Focus on your
[thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md), [actions](actions.md), and attitude. Pursuing
external things (such as wealth) is misguided because those pleasures are
dependent on factors outside your control. They will be ultimately unsatisfying.
If you rely on external pleasure, you expose yourself to the opportunity for
failure and sadness. [True happiness](happiness-flourishing.md) comes from
[virtuous living](acting-virtue.md).

Do not avoid pain or loss. They are inevitable parts of life. Instead, focus on
your response to them. Accept them with [equanimity](inner-peace.md).
Align yourselves with the natural order of things to avoid unnecessary internal
suffering. The key is to distinguish between what you can control and what you
cannot. If you focus on avoiding the inevitable things in life, you allow your
emotional reaction to dominate you.
