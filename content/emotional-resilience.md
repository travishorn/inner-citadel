# Emotional Resilience

Master passions and overcome destructive emotions. Freedom and tranquility come
from **controlling emotions through reason**.
[Passions](destructive-emotions.md) are intense and irrational emotional
responses (like [anger](anger.md), [fear](fear.md), or
[jealousy](envy-jealousy.md)) that disrupt your peace of mind and lead you away
from virtuous living.

[Passions are not inevitable human experiences but are irrational
judgments](passions-irrational-judgments.md) based on false beliefs. Master
passions with [reason](role-reason.md). Understand the distinction between [what
is within your control and what is outside your control](dichotomy-control.md).
The more you do this, the closer you come to [accepting
reality](love-fate.md).

[Practice](key-practices-exercises.md) strengthening your emotional resilience.

Master passions by applying reason and the cultivating virtue. Recognize that
destructive emotions are the result of your misguided judgment about external
events. Aim to correct those judgments and focus on what is within your control.
Use techniques like [cognitive reappraisal](cognitive-reappraisal.md), [negative
visualization](negative-visualization.md), and
[self-reflection](self-reflection.md) to learn to respond to life's challenges
and maintain [inner tranquility](inner-peace.md).
