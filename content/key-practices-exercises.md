# Key Practices & Exercises

Challenges are inevitable. How you react to them determines your well-being. Use
these key practices to better prepare yourself for them mentally and
emotionally. These exercises lessen the impact of hardships, boosting your
[emotional resilience](emotional-resilience.md).

- **Prepare for emotional challenges** by practicing [negative
  visualization](negative-visualization.md). Mentally rehearse possible negative
  outcomes so that when these events occur, you are emotionally prepared.
- Use [cognitive reappraisal](cognitive-reappraisal.md) as a psychological
  technique to **reframe negative events** in a rational (and often more positive)
  light.
- Practice [self-reflection](self-reflection.md) to **examine your
  [thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md)**, emotions, and [actions](actions.md).
- [**Detach from external things**](detachment-externals.md) like wealth, status,
  or even physical health. These are "indifferent" to achieving [true
  happiness](happiness-flourishing.md).
- Intentionally [expose yourself to temporary, controlled
  discomfort](voluntary-discomfort.md) to better prepare for life's inevitable
  challenges.

Focus on [**living with virtue**](acting-virtue.md) to achieve [long-term
fulfillment](happiness-flourishing.md).
