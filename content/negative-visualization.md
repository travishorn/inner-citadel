# Negative Visualization

Prepare for emotional challenges by practicing negative visualization.
**Mentally rehearse possible negative outcomes** such as illness, loss, or death
so that when these events occur, you are emotionally prepared and less likely to
react with [fear](fear.md) or distress. **Imagine worst-case scenarios** to
[cultivate acceptance](love-fate.md). This allows you to approach life with more
[resilience](emotional-resilience.md).

Set aside time each day to **think about potential challenges** and **how you
might handle them**. [Write down your thoughts](self-reflection.md)
about what could go wrong in specific situations and how you would respond. Stay
calm by focusing on [your own _response_ to
adversity](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control).

By preparing for the worst, you gain a better perspective and can overcome
challenges more easily.
