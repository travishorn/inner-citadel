# Other People's Actions & Opinions

You cannot control how **others behave**, what they **say**, or what they
**think** of you. Their [actions](actions.md) are a result of _their own_
judgments, which are [outside your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control). Rather than trying
to change other people or worrying about their opinion, focus on [your own
virtuous response](acting-virtue.md) to what they say or do.

You cannot change how others think or behave. However, your reaction is shaped
by [your perception](thoughts-judgments.md). So look at it objectively. Do not
let your emotions dictate your response. Do this, and you will avoid distress,
allowing you to maintain [inner peace](inner-peace.md).

Everyone has their own struggle, story, and perspective. [Do not attach yourself
external validation.](detachment-externals.md) Do not be affected by others
people's opinions. Prioritize your own character over their judgment.
