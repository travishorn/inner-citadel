# Destructive Emotions

Destructive emotions (also called **passions**) **disrupt your peace of mind**
and **lead you away from rational living**. These emotions are not natural,
uncontrollable forces, but the result of [faulty
judgments](passions-irrational-judgments.md) about what is good or bad. You can
master your emotional responses and achieve greater tranquility by understanding
where destructive emotions come from and learning to [reinterpret external
events through reason](cognitive-reappraisal.md).

[Anger](anger.md) is one of the most destructive emotions because it arises from
perceived injury or injustice and leads to irrational [actions](actions.md).

[Fear](fear.md), especially the fear of loss or death, is based on the false
belief that something external is inherently bad.

[Envy & jealousy](envy-jealousy.md) arise from comparing oneself to others and
desiring what others have.
