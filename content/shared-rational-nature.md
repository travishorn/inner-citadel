# Shared Rational Nature

**All people possess reason.** It is the spark that connects us to the universe
and each other. This shared rationality is what binds us together, regardless of
our differences. Differences in wealth, power, and privilege are superficial
compared to the fundamental equality provided by our rational nature.

We are all [connected](interconnectedness.md) to each other by reason. It links
our minds to a greater rational order. Rationality is [a common
bond](cosmopolitanism.md) (not an individual trait) that unites us with nature.
We have the ability to live in harmony with the order of the universe by
aligning our [thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md) and [actions](actions.md) with
it. Align yourself in this way to achieve [happiness](happiness-flourishing.md).

Due to our shared rational nature, [you have a duty](duty-others.md) to [act
virtuously](acting-virtue.md) towards others. [Respect others' capacity for
reason](respect-others.md) and support the [well-being of your
community](community-engagement.md).
