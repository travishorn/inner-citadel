# Self-Reflection

Practice self-reflection to **examine your thoughts, emotions, and actions**.
Reflect on your day by journaling to identify where you allowed strong emotions
to [disturb you](destructive-emotions.md). Think about how you can correct your
thinking and behavior to align more with [virtue](cardinal-virtues.md) and
[reason](role-reason.md).

Be constantly self-aware. Examine your own thoughts. At night, review your day
to assess whether you [lived according to your values](acting-virtue.md).
Consider times you practiced [wisdom](wisdom.md), [courage](courage.md),
[justice](justice.md), and [temperance](temperance.md). Consider any
opportunities to practice them that you might have missed. Ask yourself if you
were rational and [not attached to external events](detachment-externals.md).

Practice mindfulness in [the present moment](time-present-moment.md). Make sure
your decisions are guided by reason rather than emotion.

Use a journal to examine your emotional reactions and moments of both strength
and weakness. Use what you discover to correct misjudgments and improve your
character.

## Sample Prompts

Here are some questions you can ask yourself:

- What events today were beyond my control? How did I respond to them?
- Did I act according to my values and principles in my decisions today?
- What emotions were in my [thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md) today? How did I
  manage them?
- What could I have done differently today?
- How did I handle challenges or adversity today?
- Was there a moment when I [acted](actions.md) impulsively? How could I have
  acted more rationally?
- What desires or attachments am I clinging to that are hindering my inner
  peace?
- Did I focus on what I can control and let go of what I cannot?
- How will I better act with virtue tomorrow?
