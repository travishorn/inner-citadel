# Virtue as the Highest Good

Virtue is the **foundation of ethical living**. It is moral excellence. It is
necessary for [happiness and flourishing](happiness-flourishing.md). Living
virtuously is [living in accordance with nature](living-accordance-nature.md).
Align your [actions](actions.md), desires, and
[thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md) with the natural order of the universe.

Virtue comes from rationality, which is your natural function as a human being.
Live according to the [cardinal virtues](cardinal-virtues.md) of
[wisdom](wisdom.md), [courage](courage.md), [justice](justice.md), and
[temperance](temperance.md).

Material things, health, and status, are all "indifferent" because they do not
contribute to moral worth or happiness themselves. What makes an action good is
whether it builds virtuous character, not whether it contributes to preferred
outcomes or [external things](external-events.md).

Virtue is sufficient to achieve happiness. It allows you to maintain [inner
peace](inner-peace.md) regardless of external conditions. Even through
difficulties, a virtuous person can flourish because their happiness depends
entirely on their moral character.
