# Envy & Jealousy

Envy and jealousy arise from **comparing yourself to others** and **desiring
what other people have**.

Focus on what is [truly valuable](cardinal-virtues.md) and not on material or
external things, which are indifferent. Other people's success and possessions
do not have any effect on your own capacity for virtue. When you realize this,
envy fades away.

External things that you might desire are not within your direct control, so
they should not be the basis for your happiness. Desiring what others have is an
[irrational emotion](passions-irrational-judgments.md). Do not allow yourself to
be disturbed by external desires. It leads to unnecessary suffering. Focus on
your own actions and character. Those things are within your control and _do_
define your [happiness](happiness-flourishing.md).

Envy and jealousy are also harmful to your relationships with others. They
create a wall between you and those you envy or are jealous of. This brings
resentment and conflict. Instead of harboring those emotions, practice kindness,
gratitude, and understanding. Everyone has their own path. The success or
happiness of others does not prevent you from reaching your own. Rise above
comparisons to find peace in your own [thoughts](thoughts-judgments.md) and
[actions](actions.md).
