# Happiness and Flourishing

Happiness does not come from pleasure or emotional satisfaction. It comes from
**achieving your highest potential by living with virtue**, also known as
**flourishing**. Virtue is the only condition necessary for flourishing.
External things like wealth, health, and status are [not inherently good or
bad](detachment-externals.md). They are "indifferent" and do not contribute to
flourishing. To flourish, [align yourself with natural
order](living-accordance-nature.md), [accept whatever happens](love-fate.md),
and focus on [what is within your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-within-our-control).

Seeking pleasure or avoiding discomfort is misguided because those feelings
depend on external circumstances outside your control. True happiness comes from
within; from things in your control. Happiness is closely tied to [inner
peace](inner-peace.md).

Find happiness by maintaining inner peace. Cultivate virtues like
[wisdom](wisdom.md), [courage](courage.md), [justice](justice.md), and
[temperance](temperance.md).
