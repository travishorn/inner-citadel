# Preferred and Dispreferred Indifferents

Some [external things](external-events.md) in life are neither good nor bad in
themselves but can still be **preferred or dispreferred** based on how much they
contribute to living a virtuous life.

**Preferred indifferents** are not inherently good, but they can be helpful in
living a virtuous life. For example, good health can enable you to better serve
others and fulfill your duties.

**Dispreferred indifferents** are not inherently bad, but they can present
obstacles to living a virtuous life. For example, poverty often brings emotional
burdens like stress and [fear](fear.md), which can cloud judgment and make it
harder to act in [accordance with reason](living-accordance-nature.md).

[Do not become attached](detachment-externals.md) to preferred indifferents or
overly averse to dispreferred ones. Instead, view them with a neutral mindset.
They are ultimately [outside your
control](dichotomy-control.md#what-is-outside-our-control).

Make more informed choices in life by prioritizing things that are conducive to
virtue while maintaining a detached attitude toward those that are not.
